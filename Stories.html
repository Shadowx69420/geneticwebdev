        <h1>Emilio's Story</h1>
        <p>“This has been a breakthrough year for Emilio,” says his mom, Lori.

            “He’s learned to write his name and count to 10, and he’s drawing some really neat pictures at school.”

            Emilio was born with Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) and cleft lip and palate, and his speech has also transformed this year. Instead of rushing to speak and then garbling his words, Emilio had an extra incentive to slow down and speak clearly — he wanted to talk to his new friends. And they’ve taught him fun new phrases like, “no way, Jose.”
            
            Another triumph for Emilio came in October 2018 when he was named a champion for the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Buddy Walk® and Family Fun Day. CHOP Buddy Walk® celebrates children and adults with Down syndrome and raises important funds to support the Trisomy 21 Program at CHOP year-round.
            
            “It is truly a special event and there is such camaraderie among the families who participate,” Lori says. “It’s also a great way to show Emilio that he’s not alone, that there are other kids like him — and that they can be successful and happy as adults.”<br>
            <br>
            Emilio has had his share of health issues since birth. Along with surgery to repair his cleft lip and palate, Emilio also had his tonsils and adenoids removed to improve his sleep apnea, and he takes medication for hypothyroidism and wears glasses. Through it all, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia has been by his side.
            
            “We’ve had amazing support from CHOP,” Lori says. “Anytime we’ve had a concern, they’ve been there for us and helped us get Emilio the services he needed.”<br>
            <br>
            Mary Pipan, MD, Director of the Trisomy 21 Program, made sure Emilio received all the recommended preventative screenings for children with Down syndrome at the appropriate ages. The goal of these screenings is to identify potential health risks early and provide treatment as needed. Emilio also benefited from county-provided early intervention services — such as physical, occupational and speech therapy — to improve his early developmental skills.
            
            The Trisomy 21 Program continues to oversee Emilio’s care and ongoing monitoring from specialists in plastic surgery, endocrinology, pulmonology, ophthalmology, ear, nose and throat, and others.<br>
            <br>        
            Life with Emilio is never boring, Lori says. A wiry and active boy, he enjoys going to the playground, eats everything in sight, and is obsessed with Halloween.
            
            “He loves the Ghostbusters song and will play it over and over and over on YouTube,” Lori says. “And every week when his class goes to the library, he finds a new Halloween book to bring home for us to read. Even the librarian is curious about how he finds them all.”
            
            Emilio loves Minions, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and superheroes. In fact, he says, when he grows up he wants to be a superhero because he’s “strong and wants to fly.”<br>
            <br>
            As Lori looks ahead to Emilio’s future as an adult, she finds encouragement and hope from the team at CHOP’s Trisomy 21 Program and from a strong Down syndrome support group in Montgomery County.
            
            “There are so many more opportunities for kids with Down syndrome today compared to 40 years ago,” Lori says. “As a parent, I want Emilio to be as independent as possible.”
            
            To accomplish that long-term goal, Emilio’s parents enrolled him in public school, where he can interact with typically developing children as well as children, like him, who need a little extra help. Emilio attends classes with his peers and receives additional support services as needed.
            
            “Later, we hope he’ll get vocational training or attend college so he can find a career he enjoys and contribute to society,” Lori says. “Emilio is a very determined boy. I have no doubt he will succeed.” </p>

        <h1>Sarah's Story</h1>
        <p>When you ask Sara to describe what it’s like to be in college, her list is long and upbeat. “Surprising, inspiring, supportive, thoughtful, fun, friendships, career independence,” says the 21-year-old about her experience at East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania, where she’s in her second year of the college’s Career, Independent Living & Learning Studies (CILLS) program.

            “I like being who I am and where I am,” she says, with a big smile that confirms that sentiment. Her mother, Susan, is beaming as well. This is exactly where she hoped her daughter would be at this stage in her life.
            
            It was possible because of the guidance of the Trisomy 21 Program at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), strong support from Sara’s teachers and nondisabled peers from kindergarten through high school, and loving encouragement from her family and friends.
            
            “We’re completely thrilled she’s doing so well,” says Susan. “I know she’s really happy. She was well prepared.”<br>
            <br>            
            Sara has been part of CHOP’s Trisomy 21 Program since its inception 16 years ago. Sara’s mother and a handful of other parents of children with Down syndrome organized the first local Buddy Walk® in the Villanova University stadium parking lot to raise funds to help children with Down syndrome, also known as trisomy 21. There was no Down syndrome program or clinic in Philadelphia — no central place to help families like theirs to get answers to common questions about the disorder and its effects. The families brought the funds they raised to CHOP and encouraged the hospital to start such a program.
            
            Today, CHOP's Trisomy 21 Program provides care for more than 2,000 families, has a robust research arm, and continues to grow each year. The annual CHOP Buddy Walk® and Family Fun Day continues to be a critical funding source for the program.
            
            “Through working with CHOP and understanding our children’s possibilities, we learned you need to have goals, which then become achievable,” says Susan. “In our family we always say, ‘It never hurts to try. If you don’t try, you’ll never know.’ That has served Sara well.”<br>
            <br>            
            When Sara wanted to try a dance class with nondisabled kids, she did — and then invited her friends to the recital. Did she want to make cookies? Sure, and had friends over for a baking party. Try running track? Why not? Unified Sports, which has a 50/50 split of kids with intellectual disabilities and those who are typically developing, all training and competing together, was the perfect fit. The same for trying out for the local swim club’s team, going to sleep-away summer camp, and being included in regular classes. With modified tests and a lot of hard work, Sara excelled with a 3.7 GPA and was inducted into the Cheltenham High School National Honor Society.
            
            It was Kim Schadt, MSN, CRNP, CCRP, Co-director of the T21 Program, who told the family about a website, thinkcollege.net, that lists colleges across the country that offer programs for students with intellectual disabilities.<br>
            <br>            
            The more Sara and Susan explored different programs, the more excited they became. East Stroudsburg University’s CILLS program had the added bonus of being only 90 minutes away from their home. “Going to college was my goal,” Sara says. She put together a slideshow, highlighting her accomplishments and readiness for college, to accompany her application. She was accepted.
            
            ESU accepts eight to 10 students in CILLS each year. Students take CILLS-specific classes on career exploration, health and wellness, communication strategies, personal finance and more. They can also choose to audit regular ESU classes. Each CILLS student is encouraged to join a campus activity, and Sara became part of the cheer squad.<br>
            <br>            
            CILLS students eat lunch and dinner in the ESU cafeteria with other students. Every day they have two hours of exercise at the university fitness center, which some days includes yoga or Zumba class. Each student is paired with an ESU student who serves as a peer mentor, who spends time with them between the end of CILLS programming and when they return to their home.
            
            CILLS students also are matched with a volunteer Best Buddy®. Rachel was Sara’s Best Buddy, and they went to a wide variety of campus events together. “We went to football and lacrosse games and tennis,” Sara says. They’d go to other on-campus activities, shopping or to a movie, often with other CILLS students and their Best Buddies. There are organized Best Buddies events, including a big dance at the end of the spring semester. “We stayed in touch all summer, texting each other,” Sara says. “Rachel follows me on Instagram.”
            
            CILLS students live in houses off campus with a house manager, who is in the house 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. They have assigned chores, have to keep their room clean, and have to do their own laundry. On weekends, they cook their own meals.
            
            “I knew she was doing really well when she didn’t call home for the first 2 ½ weeks,” Susan says. “I finally reached her on her cell and she says, ‘I’m fine, Mom. But I don’t have time to talk. I’m eating lunch with my new friends.’ ’’
            
            Sara’s explanation sounds like any 21-year-old: “It was good to be away from my parents. I need space.”<br>
            <br>            
            She did have to make some adjustments to life away from home. There were many new people to get to know and more choices to make. For example, the school cafeteria is set up like a buffet every day, so she had to draw upon what Mary Pipan, MD, Co-director of the T21 Program and her long-time developmental pediatrician, taught her about green, yellow and red food categories.
            
            “Green foods, like salad and fruit, are good for you, so you should eat them the most,” Sara explains. “Yellows are OK, but not too much. Reds, like brownies, are only sometimes, for something special.”
            
            The lesson worked. She didn’t gain a single pound during her freshman year.<br>
            <br>            
            When Susan suggested that Sara and her new friends from CILLS come from East Stroudsburg to Villanova for the CHOP Buddy Walk® in 2018, everyone was enthusiastic. A large group of students and Best Buddies from ESU came, with handmade signs, to participate and support the T21 Program.
            
            “It was awesome,” Sara says. “Everyone had a fabulous time. I always love it because I see so many friends who also have Down syndrome at the CHOP Buddy Walk® every year.”<br>
            <br>            
            They’ll be there again this year. “Starting a local Buddy Walk here was a way to fund a program,” Susan says. “My chief interest was to start a consolidated health program for children with trisomy 21. A child has to be healthy to learn, to develop, and to have a high quality of life. The healthcare has to come first.”
            
            Mission accomplished. She’s just described her daughter: Healthy and enjoying a high quality of life. </p>

        <h1>Eve's Story</h1>
        <p>When Eve celebrates her 16th birthday in August, it will be filled with friends, family, music and dancing. The theme of the party is “Paris” — a perfect match for Eve’s love of fashion, travel, makeup and glamour.

            “Eve loves to have fun,” says her mom, Suzanne. “She has a full personality, and she’s really well-rounded. She loves music, dancing, fashion and shopping. She also loves sports, particularly soccer and tennis.”
            
            Eve was born with Down syndrome and several related conditions. She has been a patient at the Trisomy 21 Program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) since she was a year old and regularly sees behavioral pediatrician Mary Pipan, MD, Director of the Trisomy 21 Program.<br>
            <br>            
            Children with Down syndrome (also known as trisomy 21) often have a multitude of health conditions. Eve certainly has had her share — everything from multiple ear infections to a congenital heart defect. She's had multiple surgeries at CHOP and continues to see specialists to monitor and treat her thyroid, sleep apnea and heart conditions, as well as her food allergies.
            
            In the past few years, however, Eve’s medical issues have stabilized. She has always thrived despite her multitude of medical issues and doctor appointments. She's a fighter. Her academic and social life are now blossoming due — in no small part — to her determination and grit. Suzanne credits the speech and occupational therapy Eve has had for her success, as well as Eve’s hard work.
            
            "Everything is a breakthrough for Eve. She always surpasses our expectations," Suzanne says. "We didn't know if she would ever talk or walk or read, but she can do all of those things and more. She loves to travel and learn new things. She's always exploring and her interests are unlimited."<br>
            <br>            
            Eve attends a public high school in Gloucester County, NJ, where she is in a combination of resource room, self-contained and general education courses. She particularly enjoys science and cooking classes with her typically developing peers. Eve is hoping to try out for the tennis team soon and would like to become more involved in school clubs. She loves high school.
            
            “I always felt that her being around typical-developing peers is the most important thing, and for her to have good role models,” explains Suzanne. “I’ve always advocated for that, but it has been difficult getting her integrated over the years.”
            
            Eve shares her love of fashion and music with her older sister, Madeline, who is a junior at Hofstra University and is currently spending a semester abroad in Italy. Eve's love of travel was sparked by numerous family trips to the Caribbean islands and Disney World.
            
            Recently, Eve’s parents noticed a maturation of her social skills. When she was younger, she would share anything and everything that she was thinking. “We’ve worked hard to get her to learn when to keep some things in her head and not say them aloud,” Suzanne says.<br>
            <br>            
            “We’ve had her in speech therapy since birth before she was verbal. I will never give up on improving her speech," says Suzanne. "Her ability to communicate appropriately is our #1 concern. I can’t stress how amazing her therapists have been, and now she’s in this social skills group that has been very helpful and the kids have become friends. Eve never complains about going. I’m so appreciative of that.”
            
            Eve loves to hang out with friends, play mini-golf, shop and go to restaurants. She’s physically very active: She plays soccer in Special Olympics each year, plays tennis year-round, and participates in a therapeutic riding program, private dance therapy and fitness classes.
            
            Suzanne says Dr. Pipan has helped the family navigate Eve's developmental milestones and advocate for her at school. Dr. Pipan has also recommended programs and services that could benefit Eve.<br>
            <br>            
            “Every year, Dr. Pipan asks just the right questions," Suzanne says. "She knows what kids with Down syndrome are more susceptible to than the general population, and it’s not just the developmental stuff. She wants to know how Eve is doing at school. She looks at patients holistically.”
            
            If you ask Eve what she wants to be when she grows up, she won’t hesitate to tell you: a scientist. She loves science and biology.<br>
            <br>            
            “I feel like whatever job she is in, she will be such as asset because of her ability to communicate and be positive, coupled with the fact that she’s very conscientious about whatever work she does,” Suzanne says.
            
            Eve and her family have participated in the CHOP Buddy Walk® or the National Down Syndrome Society Buddy Walk every year since she was born. The close-knit family of four is extremely grateful for the Trisomy 21 Program and the care and support they all have received from CHOP over the years.
            
            “It's comforting to know that there is a whole team of people looking out for our kids, people who are constantly learning and researching Down syndrome," Suzanne says. "They are there to guide us through every chapter of our life.”
            
            Thanks to CHOP and her family, Eve has matured into a kind, curious, playful and determined teenager. She's excited to represent other kids with Down syndrome as a CHOP Buddy Walk® Champion for this year's event in October 2019. </p>

        <h1>Brody's Story</h1>
        <p>Fifth grade was a good year for Brody. He enjoyed school, loved his job sorting mail and delivering it to the teachers at his school, and his classmates voted him as having the “best winning smile.”

            Now 12, Brody has come a long way in a short time. Born with Down syndrome (trisomy 21), a developmental disorder that causes intellectual disabilities and a host of potential other medical issues, Brody is deaf in one ear and had severely limited communication skills during his early years. He communicated with his family using sign language until his verbal skills caught up.
            
            Today, Brody is a fairly typical pre-teen boy who likes to talk, listen to music, and meet new people. The medical issues he has — near-sightedness, seasonal allergies and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) — affect many of his typically developing peers. But nothing can damper the spirit of the rising sixth grader.
            
            “He is outgoing, friendly and even stubborn at times,” says his mom, Kim.<br>
            <br>            
            Brody is especially particular about his collection of trucks in his bedroom, and if one is out of place, he knows it. His bedroom is decorated in shades of orange, blue and yellow, all bright colors to provide stimulation, his mother says. He has a bed that is more like a tent — with stars that dot across the ceiling — and he can "camp out" whenever he wants. Most days after school, Brody retreats to his room to listen to music and sing.
            
            Brody has been a patient of the Trisomy 21 Program at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) for only two years, but his family has long attended the CHOP Buddy Walk® and Family Fun Day. This year's event is extra special to Brody and his family because he is representing thousands of children and young adults with the disorder as a CHOP Buddy Walk® Champion. Brody and his family plan to wear matching T-shirts and walk under the “Lil Pez” banner, short for their last name.
            
            The 18th annual event raises critical funds that support breakthroughs in research, family-centered care, and treatment for people with Down syndrome.<br>
            <br>            
            "The Trisomy 21 Program and its wonderful staff have helped us keep a step ahead in caring for Brody's needs," says Kim. "We've been impressed with how knowledgeable they are and how many resources they have available. I wish we connected with them sooner."
            
            With advances in prenatal imaging, many families learn they are having a child with Down syndrome before birth. That was not the case for Kim and Ken.
            
            After Brody was born, Ken broke the news to Kim: "It’s a boy and he has Down syndrome,” Ken said.<br>
            <br>            
            “I was in shock,” Kim says. A doctor at the local hospital gave Kim some unsolicited advice: "I know this isn’t the child you were expecting, but this is who he is and you will have to deal with it.”
            
            At first, Kim thought the words were harsh and insensitive, but years later she realizes the doctor was just being realistic. “She was just trying to harden me up,” says Kim. “It was good advice … She was saying, 'Here it is girl; this is your life.]”
            
            While most of the couple's friends expressed sorrow about Brody's Down syndrome diagnosis, Kim was exhilarated when one friend called to congratulate her, saying how lucky she and her husband were to have a child with Down syndrome.
            
            “She was right,” says Kim. “Brody is so happy about everything and anything. He is our gift.”<br>
            <br>            
            Brody loves his siblings — Carissa, 9, and Kyle, 7 — and wants to be with them all the time. That said, he’ll battle with them for the front seat spot before every family car ride. "He's the oldest and thinks he deserves it every time," Kim says. While the sibling squabble can be annoying at times, Kim says she's proud of Brody for speaking up about what he wants.
            
            Brody has a special bond with his dad, Ken. Every Sunday, they visit Ken's work, then head to Dunkin' Donuts. Their order is the same every week: coffee for Ken, 10 munchkins and apple juice for Brody. And, of course, they bring treats home for the rest of the family.
            
            Brody is also very close to his maternal grandfather, who lives across the street from his family, and he loves spending time with his paternal grandparents at their beach house in Ocean City, NJ.
            
            Brody can do many things for himself, but his family continues to help him with certain everyday tasks like tying his shoes.
            
            “He does things I never thought he would," Kim says. "And sometimes he amazes me with what he can do."<br>
            <br>            
            For example, Brody has an incredible sense of direction. "He only has to go somewhere once and then he's telling me where to turn to go back," she says.
            
            When Brody made his first Holy Communion, Kim said she was worried he wouldn’t accept the communion wafer — just to show off his stubborn side. Instead, Brody graciously accepted the host and then "turned around and gave us the thumbs up,” Kim says with a laugh.
            
            Brody's long-term future is uncertain. His parents anticipate he'll live with them for life, though they are open to the possibility of a group home with his peers if that's something he's interested in. They also hope he'll be able to work and contribute to his community.<br>
            <br>            
            For now, though, Brody's parents are trying to keep up his routine and build in some fun, special events like the CHOP Buddy Walk® and summer camp. Brody is attending an extended school program during the summer and is looking forward to his third trip to the Variety Club Camp, which caters to children with special needs. </p>

        <h1>Julianna's Story</h1>
        <p>If you’re out and about in Phoenixville, PA, you may very well run into Julianna — that’s her stomping ground.

            She may be working as a barista at the Soltane Café or the Steel City Coffee House and Brewery, where she’s also a regular on open mic night, presenting her original poetry. You can often find her at the Phoenixville Y, in a Zumba or yoga class. Some days she volunteers at the local animal shelter. She might also be in her apartment, helping make dinner or hanging out with her housemate, Betsy.
            
            Julianna is very much a typical 30-year-old enjoying life. The fact that she has Down syndrome is just another facet of who she is.<br>
            <br>            
            “I love working as a barista,” Julianna says. “It’s my passion and my hobby. Ever since I was 14, I wanted to be a barista.”
            
            Her father, Jon, says, “She’s always been very social, so it’s the perfect job for her. She lives quite independently, with a housemate and a support person. Phoenixville is a friendly, safe environment for her. She knows half the people in town.”
            
            Julianna “grew up” in the Camphill Movement, an approach that follows the holistic Waldorf education model. She attended Camphill Special School in Glenmoore.<br>
            <br>            
            She’s had the opportunity to travel, going to Israel, Ireland and California. Until five years ago, she lived at Camphill Soltane, a community in Phoenixville for young adults with developmental disabilities that teaches vocational and life skills.
            
            Julianna is a star of Camphill Soltane. “She’s the first one to live in an apartment off campus,” Jon says. “It’s been great for her.”
            
            Julianna and her housemate get help from a rotating group of staff who live at the apartment. Since neither woman drives, the support person takes them grocery shopping and to activities they can’t walk to. They get help planning meals and cooking, but take responsibility for keeping the apartment and their rooms clean.
            
            “I love cooking, especially making pasta,” Julianna says. “I’m a master of frying up mushrooms. Two of the staff are vegan, so we eat a lot of vegetables and other healthy things.”
            
            One of the staff always stays overnight, “so someone is here in case we need them,” she says.<br>
            <br>            
            Her dad says the arrangement allows Julianna her well-earned independence, but also provides the support she needs. “She’s really quite happy,” he says. “I think it’s helpful for parents of children with Down syndrome to know there’s a future for their children and that things will change for the better.”
            
            Julianna’s parents found the Trisomy 21 Program at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) a couple of years ago. She has the mosaic form of Down syndrome, a rare type accounting for only 2% of affected persons. Instead of every cell having the extra copy of chromosome 21, in those with mosaic T21, only some cells have the extra copy.
            
            “We’ve been very lucky, medical-wise,” her father says. Her only cardiac issue was an atrial septal defect, a hole in the wall between the two upper chambers of her heart, which spontaneously closed. She had early intervention to address her physical and developmental delays.
            
            “There’s a local doctor who has a large practice of patients with special needs, and given she’s been fairly healthy, he could manage things,” Jon says. “We’re glad we found CHOP’s T21 Program. We hadn’t realized there was a world-famous center right down the road.”
            
            The biggest benefit from the Trisomy 21 Program has been to confirm and reinforce what they already knew. Julianna has sleep apnea, and now she’s more consistent about using her C-PAP machine because T21 Program Medical Director Mary Pipan, MD, emphasized it. Same goes for wearing orthotics to help her feet.
            
            “Having another voice from outside Julianna’s world tell her these things brought gravity to it,” Jon says.<br>
            <br>            
            As for Julianna’s opinion of the clinic, which treats adults as well as children with T21: “I really liked it. Everyone was so nice.”
            
            Julianna has also taken to heart the advice to live a healthy lifestyle. “I know it’s important to eat healthy and to exercise,” she says. “That’s why I love Zumba. I advocate it especially for people with Down syndrome. If you’re overweight, you have to work out. With Zumba, you get a good workout and have fun. It helped me lose a lot of weight. I also walk everywhere I can. I can walk to both my jobs.”
            
            So, the next time you’re in Phoenixville, stop in one of the coffee shops where Julianna works. She will be more than happy to make you a mocha latte, cappuccino or, her personal favorite, a dirty chai. “It’s chai with espresso and milk,” she says, “and it’s fabulous.” </p>

        <h1>Aidan's Story</h1>
        <p>Every day is a new adventure for Aidan. The chubby 1-year-old embraces each new challenge with a twinkle in his bright blue eyes and a big smile on his face.

            His breakthroughs are small but meaningful to his tight-knit family: waving goodbye, playing peekaboo, shoving Cheerios into his mouth, rolling after his 3-year-old brother Ryan, and singing himself to sleep at night.
            
            “He’s such a happy baby,” says his mom, Meghan. “He’s curious and cuddly and silly. He loves kisses and pulling hair, and is trying really hard to crawl. I can’t wait to see what he discovers next.”
            
            It was the night before Thanksgiving in 2016 when Meghan and her husband, Blake, received the results of a routine prenatal screening test. They were having a boy … and he had a 99 percent chance of having Down syndrome, the most common chromosomal anomaly.
            
            A follow-up test confirmed the diagnosis, also known as trisomy 21. The genetic disorder, created by three chromosomes at position 21 instead of the usual pair, can cause intellectual disabilities and health issues.
            
            “We were shocked, devastated and scared,” Meghan says. “We didn’t know what his future would look like — or what our family’s future would be.”<br>
            <br>            
            Meghan and Blake sought out information about Down syndrome, including possible complications from the disorder, and looked for resources that could support them and their child.
            
            Almost everywhere they turned for help, they found encouraging news. Their pediatrician told them what to expect medically, gave them examples of what individuals with Down syndrome had accomplished, and connected them with the Trisomy 21 Program at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP).
            
            They also spoke with Tricia D. Wilson, RN, nurse coordinator of the Trisomy 21 Program, who shared her personal experience of having a child with Down syndrome.<br>
            <br>            
            “Tricia was so reassuring,” Meghan says. “Life for her family wasn’t all that different or scary. In fact, she said their lives were richer because they had a child with Down syndrome.”
            
            Meghan and Blake also received good news mid-way through the pregnancy: Their baby did not have a heart problem. Cardiac issues are common in children with Down syndrome and many need surgery within the first year of life.
            
            “We were just so excited to meet him, to celebrate him, and to expand our family,” Meghan says.<br>
            <br>            
            Aidan was born on June 2, 2017. As an infant, he began receiving Early Intervention services from Chester County to help develop his communication, motor and play skills.
            
            When Aidan was about a month old, he received support from the Feeding and Swallowing Outpatient Clinic at CHOP. “He had low muscle tone and his endurance was low,” Meghan explains. “He was falling asleep before getting enough milk in his belly.”
            
            Aidan was 5 months old when he met the Trisomy 21 Program team who would develop a care plan to help him develop to his fullest potential. Aidan’s care team includes Alison H. Downes, MD, a developmental pediatrician; Wilson; Audrey Vincent, MSW, LSW, a social worker; as well as a physical therapist, occupational therapist and speech therapist.
            
            At the recommendation of the Trisomy 21 team, Aidan completed several screening tests. He has been cleared by a cardiologist, has seen an eye doctor, and has been evaluated by audiology twice.<br>
            <br>            
            “The team was initially concerned that he was slow to gain weight, but now he’s a chunky monkey,” Meghan says with a laugh.
            
            Aidan was only a few months old when his family learned about the 2017 CHOP Buddy Walk® and Family Fun Day. They thought it would be a great way to build awareness of Down syndrome and help the Trisomy 21 Program, which will be supporting Aidan for years to come. Meghan and Blake formed a team and invited friends and family to join them for the event.
            
            “It was just a beautiful day,” Meghan says. “It was a day filled with hope for us — hope that Aidan would be accepted by others and hope that he’d be able to one day do the things these other kids could do — running, talking, laughing, enjoying life. It was so inspiring to see children and adults with Down syndrome accomplishing their goals.”
            
            In 2019, Aidan's family expanded their participation in the CHOP Buddy Walk, inspiring more support from around the country.<br>
            <br>            
            “Aidan has brought so much joy to our lives,” Meghan says. “I want to celebrate him and celebrate his uniqueness. I want him to appreciate his differences and to forge his own path and his own future.” </p>
