        <p>In nature, bacteria use CRISPR systems to identify and disable the genes of attacking viruses. 

          The scientific insight was that this bacterial immune system, an acronym for "clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats," could be repurposed to edit cells of plants, animals and people. 
          
          CRISPR has the ability to find a specific spot in a strand of DNA and make a cut, add or swap a genetic "letter" or even a word. 
          
          "It's truly wondrous," said Fyodor Urnov, a gene editor at the University of California Berkeley's Innovative Genomics Institute. "It has worked in every biological setting that it has been placed into. Imagine somebody who can be a stellar performer in a heavy metal band and a symphony orchestra."
          
          In late June 2012, biochemists Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier published a paper describing how CRISPR works to edit genes. (The pair earned a Nobel Prize in chemistry in 2020 for their finding.) In January 2013, two other groups of researchers from Harvard and MIT showed they could use CRISPR to edit the cells of mammals. 
          
          Earlier this month, Doudna, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, published a paper in the journal Science, noting the progress CRISPR has brought so far and its continued promise. 
          
          "CRISPR has come a long way in just 10 years, farther than I could have imagined when our paper was first published," she said in a follow-up email. "Each year we're seeing more clinical trials for CRISPR therapies, and new applications."</p>

        <p>Earlier this month, Doudna, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, published a paper in the journal Science, noting the progress CRISPR has brought so far and its continued promise. 
          "CRISPR has come a long way in just 10 years, farther than I could have imagined when our paper was first published," she said in a follow-up email. "Each year we're seeing more clinical trials for CRISPR therapies, and new applications."
          
          Jennifer Doudna, co-inventor of the CRISPR gene-editing tool, shared the 2020 Nobel Prize for chemistry with Emmanuelle Charpentier.
          Gene editing existed before CRISPR, but it wasn't as efficient. CRISPR is easy to use, fast and allows much more precision in the edits than earlier technologies, several experts said.
          
          "There are many instances that without CRISPR, our life as scientists would be much more difficult," said Beverly Davidson, a neuroscientist at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
          
          CRISPR is adaptable and precise, making many lab activities simpler, she said. Even undergraduates in her lab can be readily trained to get CRISPR to work. 
          
          CRISPR can still have off-target effects – hitting genes that weren't intended – but the risk is much smaller than with other editing tools.
          
          That also explains why the field of gene editing is moving slowly and deliberately, said Dr. John Leonard, president and CEO of Intellia Therapeutics, which is developing CRISPR-based treatments for rare diseases and cancer. Sloppy work could lead to cancers or other problems. </p>
        <h1>Using CRISPR to treat cancer</h1>
        <p>
          CRISPR has the potential to improve cancer treatment by ramping up the immune system.
          
          Since 2016, it's been used in trials of patients with blood cancer, editing their own immune cells outside the body to launch an immune attack on the cancer.
          
          This approach, called CAR-T, has been shown effective against several types of blood cancer.
          
          Until now, CAR-Ts has to be made for each individual patient, costing money and time the person may not have.
          
          Caribou Biosciences is working on an "off-the-shelf" version of the treatment that will be sitting in a freezer for the next patient who needs it, said Rachel Haurwitz, company CEO, president and co-founder with Doudna. This would cut weeks of preparation time and potentially cost.
          
          In its first clinical trial, six patients with non-Hodgkins lymphoma had no detectable cancer after a single dose of the therapy, Haurwitz said.</p>

  <h1>How CRISPR Works Against Rare Diseases</h1>
  <blockquote>
    More than 6,000 rare inherited diseases are caused by a single genetic "misspelling." For these, CRISPR offers the possibility of snipping the defective gene, ramping up a different one, or subbing out genetic "letters" that are causing problems. 

    The first gene therapy for sickle cell disease, based on a CRISPR snip, is expected to be approved later this year. 

    With other diseases, “it’s harder to develop a single scissors to treat all of those mutations,” said said Dr. Tippi MacKenzie, a pediatric and fetal surgeon at the University of California San Francisco.

    Pompe disease, for instance, which weakens heart and skeletal muscles and can be fatal, has 100 different variations, each of which would need a different gene edit to correct, said MacKenzie, who also directs The Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCSF.

    Researchers must either find a gene edit they can make that will correct many variants, or figure out a way to rapidly develop an edit specific to each person with the disease. 

    In her own work, MacKenzie is developing gene-editing approaches that can be used on a late-second or third trimester fetus, addressing diseases that are easier to treat in utero and would cause harm if the child is allowed to develop further.

    Editing a fetus would correct a disease, but would not be passed on to any children that child would go on to have.

    "There are multiple advantages to treating diseases before birth," MacKenzie said.

      <h4 class="heading-4">MiNA’s RNAa Platform</h4>
      <p>MiNA’s RNAa platform has been clinically validated in more than 120 patients to date. The universally designed platform has the potential to address any gene given its endogenous mechanism of action that ultimately addresses the root cause of the defective gene and enables the body to self-correct. Furthermore, working at the gene level, RNAa medicines are able to restore a cell’s own biology. This holds the potential to treat currently “undruggable” diseases.</p>

      <h4 class="heading-4">UC San Diego Research Team</h4>
      <p>The UC San Diego research team has been studying cell aging for several years, discovering that cells follow a cascade of molecular changes throughout their life until they eventually degenerate and die. However, they found that not all cells age in the same way, and this was the focus of their new research.

        They first used computer simulations of cell aging to test their ideas before moving on to modifying the aging circuits in the single-celled yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
        
        They discovered that the cells followed one of two aging routes. Around half of the cells underwent a gradual decline in the stability of their DNA (nucleolar aging); for the rest, the aging path was characterized by a decline in their mitochondriaTrusted Source – the organelles that provide energy for the cell (mitochondrial aging).</p>

      <p>The last time the world's scientists gathered to debate the pros and cons of gene-editing — in Hong Kong in late 2018 — He Jiankui, a biophysicist and researcher at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, shocked his audience with a bombshell announcement. He had created the first gene-edited babies, he told the crowd — twin girls born from embryos he had modified using the gene-editing technique CRISPR.</p>
